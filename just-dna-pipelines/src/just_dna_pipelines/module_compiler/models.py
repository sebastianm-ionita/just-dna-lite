"""
Compatibility shim — the schema now lives in the published ``just-dna-format`` package.

This module used to hold the DSL/schema models. Those were extracted to ``just-dna-format``
(``just_dna_format.spec`` for the authored DSL, ``just_dna_compiler.models`` for the compile
result types) so the schema is shared verbatim by just-dna-pipelines, just-dna-marketplace, and
just-dna-agents. Import sites inside this repo keep working via these re-exports; new code should
import from ``just_dna_format`` / ``just_dna_compiler`` directly.

Note: the old dead constants ``VALID_PRIORITIES`` (never referenced by a validator) and
``PMID_PATTERN`` (its validator was commented out) were intentionally not carried into
``just-dna-format``; see just-dna-format/docs/ROADMAP.md.
